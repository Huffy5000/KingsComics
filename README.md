King's Comics is a virtual comic book store where users can browse a collection of assorted vintage comics, purchase said comics, and read them in their bookshelf once purchased. Each user must create an account before making purchases as the comics will be placed in their bookshelf as soon as the transaction is complete, and just like that they are ready to begin reading!
